# Agile and Scrum Basics: A Simple Guide

## Agile Manifesto
The Agile Manifesto is a set of values and principles to help teams work more efficiently and deliver better software. It has four main values:
1. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.**
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation.**
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.**
4. **Responding to change over following a plan.**

## Agile Principles
There are 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto. Here are a few key ones:
1. **Customer satisfaction** through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development.
3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.
4. **Close, daily cooperation** between business people and developers.
5. **Motivated individuals** are the foundation of projects. Give them the environment and support they need.

## Scrum Values
Scrum is an Agile framework, and it has five core values:
1. **Commitment** - Be dedicated to your team's goals.
2. **Focus** - Concentrate on the work at hand.
3. **Openness** - Be open about all the work and the challenges.
4. **Respect** - Respect each other to work together well.
5. **Courage** - Have the courage to do the right thing and tackle tough problems.

## Scrum Pillars
Scrum is built on three main pillars:
1. **Transparency** - Everyone should understand the process and the work being done.
2. **Inspection** - Regularly check the progress towards goals.
3. **Adaptation** - Be willing to change plans based on inspections.

## User Stories
User stories describe features from an end-user perspective. They typically follow this format:
"As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]."

## Sprint
A Sprint is a time-boxed period (usually 2-4 weeks) where a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. At the end of the Sprint, the team should have a potentially shippable product increment.

## Velocity
Velocity measures how much work a team can complete in a Sprint. It's calculated by adding up the points for all completed user stories in the Sprint.

## Roles in Scrum
Scrum has three main roles:
1. **Product Owner** - Manages the product backlog and ensures the team delivers value to the business.
2. **Scrum Master** - Facilitates the Scrum process, helps the team stay focused, and removes obstacles.
3. **Development Team** - Does the work to build the product increment.

## Scrum Process
The Scrum process includes:
1. **Product Backlog** - A prioritized list of user stories and tasks.
2. **Sprint Planning** - Meeting to decide what work will be done in the Sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum** - Short daily meeting to sync up and plan the day’s work.
4. **Sprint Review** - Meeting at the end of the Sprint to show what’s been done.
5. **Sprint Retrospective** - Meeting to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.

## INVEST Model
The INVEST model helps create good user stories. It stands for:
- **Independent** - Stories should be self-contained.
- **Negotiable** - Details can be changed through collaboration.
- **Valuable** - Each story should deliver value to the user.
- **Estimable** - Stories should be able to be estimated in terms of effort.
- **Small** - Stories should be small enough to be completed in a Sprint.
- **Testable** - There should be a clear way to test if the story is complete.

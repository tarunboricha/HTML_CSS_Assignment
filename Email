Subject: Daily Update

Hi [Team Member's Name],

I hope you're doing well. Here’s a quick update on what I accomplished today:

1. **Architecture KT Recording:** I went through the session to better understand our project’s structure.
2. **Code Setup:** I successfully set up the code on my local machine.
3. **.NET Installation:** Installed the required version of .NET for our project.
4. **MBST Script Code:** Reviewed one of the MBST scripts to get familiar with the coding style and logic.

Please let me know if there's anything else you’d like me to focus on.

Best,
Tarun
